# pNeuma-simulator

The pNeuma-simulator is a Python-based tool for simulating multispecies urban traffic flow dynamics. It aims to provide an open-source, reproducible, and FAIR framework for traffic engineers and researchers in physics to analyze urban mobility scenarios.

## Installation

First, clone the repository. Then, install the package using

```bash
$ pip install -e .[dev]
```

For macOS users, replace `.[dev]` by `'.[dev]'`

## Usage

Run the simulation by executing the python script `run.py`. Jupyter notebooks for exploration and aggregation of the results, as well as reproducing scientific figures, are located in [notebooks/](notebooks/).

## Building the docs

To install the dependencies required to build the documentation locally, add the `docs` extra when installing, e.g. `pip install -e .[docs]` (the `dev` extra include the `docs` extra). Then, run

```bash
$ make docs
```
